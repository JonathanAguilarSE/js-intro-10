RECAP:

Data types:
1. Primitives
    - Programmer cannot create primitive data types
    1. string: text
    2. number: absolute/decimal numbers
    3. boolean: true/false
    4. undefined: when variable declared but not assigned with a value
    5. null: explicitly stating the absence of date/value
    6. bigint: large numbers
    7. symbol:

2. Reference types (objects)
    - you are allowed to create your custom objects or reference types
    - more complex

Arrays: is a collection used to store multiple data which are similar (not necesarily)
Set, Map, List

Objects: used to store key-value pairs (properties)

= vs == vs ===

=       assignment operator

Comparison
==      (loose)     checks only values and returns true if they are same value. It does not care about the data type
===     (strict)    checks both the values and types. Returns true if both are equal, or false otherwise

3 == '3'    true
3 === '3'   false


Order of Operation
- parenthesis
- exponents
- multiplication and division
- modulus/remainder
- addition and subtraction
