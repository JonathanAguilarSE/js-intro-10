assignment, arithmetic calculation, comparison, logical

Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, **, %, ++, --
Assigment: =, +=, -=, /=, *=, **=

Comparison Operators:

let x = 5, y = 10, z = '5';




Logical Operators
Result of logical operators will be boolean - meaning true or false
&& logical AND
|| logical OR
! logical NOT

When you have AND (&&) used with 2 expressions,
    - the only way to get true: both must be true
    - if one of them or both are false, then result is false

When you have OR (||) used with 2 expressions,
    - the only way to get false: both of them should be false
    - if one or both are true, then the result is true


3 <= 1          -> false


Falsy Values
0
'' ->  empty string
false
null
undefined
NaN

Any other values are truthy, except the falsy values.

Interpreted languages: JS, Ruby, Python


!false      -> true
!true       -> false





JS has a built-in Number object which has many useful properties and functions
