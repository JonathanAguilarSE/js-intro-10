GIT: Global Informaiton Tracker
    We use git to push our codes to remote repos and collaborate with our other team members or devalopers/QAs/programmers

GIT is a VCS (Version Conttrol System)
GIT is a distributed version Control

Centralized VCS: we don ot prefer this as if server is down or there is no network, we can't push our changes
Distributed VCS: we have a local copy of the server repo and can lkeep working even though there is issues with the server or network

GitHub/ GitLab/ Bitbucket/ Azure DevOps: All hosting tools/apps where we can store our remote repos

SSH: Special type of authentication used instead of username and password
It is more secure and used private-public key pairs
Public is shared with hosting apps while private is in your local
Private keys are in your local

ssh-keygen: simplest ssh setup



HOW TO CLONE AN EXISTING REMOTE REPO TO YOUR LOCAL
1. Create a remote repository
2. Clone it to your local (BUT make sure you are on the correct path)
3.
